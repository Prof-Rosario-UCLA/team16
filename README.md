# doodly

## Description
**doodly** is a real-time, multiplayer drawing game based on Pictionary. Each round, one player will be prompted to draw a word while the other players will have to guess the word via a live chat system. Points are awarded based on how fast the player can guess the word. At the end, the player with the most points is crowned the **Master Doodler**. 

## Tech Stack
The project is implemented using a typical MERN (**M**ongoDB, **E**xpress, **R**eact, **N**ode.js) stack along with Socket.io to create the real-time drawing canvas.
